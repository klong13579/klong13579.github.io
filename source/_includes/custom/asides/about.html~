<h2>about me</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a full-stack dev from Chicago now living in San Francisco. I build apps and products, such as GitRep, a platform that helps developers find and organize GitHub repos, and Lookira, a phone number owner reverse lookup site.

Here I ramble about things such as software development, building products, and living life. Radical!</p>
